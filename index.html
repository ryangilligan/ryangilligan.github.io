    <code>  
    <p>Ryan Gilligan is a mixer and engineer best known for work with Kevin Garrett, Kanye West, Anthony Ramos, Jasmine Cephas-Jones, Cynthia Erivo, Twin Shadow, FLAVIA, and Cibo Matto.</p>
    <p>He began his career in NYC at Quad Studios, before joining Busta Rhymes as his studio engineer. After a year on the road with Busta he began a 7-year mentorship with Michael Brauer at Electric Lady Studios. There, Ryan worked with artists including Coldplay, John Mayer, Kanye West, Grizzly Bear, Shakira, Hole, and many others.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Ryan resisted the urge to retire after playing trumpet on a Wu-Tang Clan record, and moved to LA to work with John Hill on music for Charlie XCX, Santigold, BØRNS, Gwen Stefani, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and others.</p>
    <p>Ryan has been awarded Grammy Certificates for work on Kanye West’s “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy”, John Mayer’s “Battle Studies”, and a Latin Grammy Certificate for Calle 13’s “Multiviral”. An early supporter of Dolby Atmos, his love for music technology led him to co-develop VR software for spatial mixing-- the concept was a 2019 SXSW Innovation Award finalist.</p>
